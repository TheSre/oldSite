                  Here's</a> some deeper research on the topic. Though almonds
                do require a great deal of water, they have very high
                nutritional and economic value. When compared to other crops,
                almonds do exceptionally well in both of these dimensions and
                actually come out quite well when considering nutritional and
                economic value per unit of water to produce. As a result, the
                story may be more nuanced and require more thought than conveyed
                in the above article.
