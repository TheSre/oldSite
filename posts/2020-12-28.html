        Most people believe that everyone's well-being should be equally valued.
        Factors that are unrelated to one's capacity to suffer should not be
        morally relevant--they should not make a difference in how we approach
        questions of morality. This is quite obvious in example: a person's race and
        gender expression, for example, should never be used as reasons to place
        a lower value on that person's interests. Despite the obviousness of
        this example, I believe that most people, myself included, are guilty
        of having gaping holes in their moral circle--the set of beings that
        they regard as deserving moral concern.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
        Firstly, we can expand the moral circle with respect to geography.
        <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en">
        Peter Singer uses a powerful example</a>: a very young Chinese girl was run
        over by a car and numerous people passed by her without helping.
        After much time, someone did finally help her, but sadly, it was too
        late and she ended up dying in the hospital. I think many would agree
        that this was an unnecessary tragedy allowed by the heinous neglect of
        the passersby and that, if put in the position of a passerby, they would surely have
        helped the poor girl. However, Singer argues, we may be guilty of
        similar neglect. The act of walking past a badly injured person
        whom we can save seems so blatantly wrong, I think, because of the
        immediacy of the person's suffering and your ability to alleviate it.
        However, it seems to me that we should care equally about the suffering
        of those whom we can't see. Massive numbers of people are
        suffering beyond our gaze and we ought to care about this too. To show
        this, imagine the same young girl who was run over.  Now, suppose you
        are the distance of a five-hour flight away from the girl. It seems
        absurd to me that the girl's suffering doesn't matter when you are this
        distance away, but upon flying to the girl's location, it suddenly does.
        Further, many of us actually do have the capacity to help those far
        away. We are lucky enough to live in a time when we are increasingly
        connected with others around the globe. There is truly a multitude of
        causes to contribute to, some that offer incredible bang for your buck.
        For example, just $2 to the Against Malaria Foundation can cover an
        anti-malaria bed net, which lasts for 3 to 4 years, and protects on
        average two people. These nets protect people from the bites of
        malaria-carrying mosquitoes that would otherwise cause severe illness
        or death. Singer argues that, when faced with such suffering--even
        remote--and the means to reduce it, we have a moral responsibility to
        take action. In this way, our moral circle should not be constrained by
        geography.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
        If we care about the suffering of conscious creatures, but are only
        concerned about the welfare of human beings and our pets, then we likely
        have a massive gap in our moral circle. It's uncontroversial that we
        should be concerned if our pets are suffering. Most people would find
        abusing a dog or neglecting a cat in extreme, curable pain to be
        immoral. However, many don't think much about the suffering of other
        animals, even though there is extremely strong scientific support (for
        example, <a
          href="http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf">
        The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness</a>, made by a team of
        prominent international scientists) for mammals, and possibly many other
        animals, being conscious. Given the billions (<a href="
          https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-and-charts/">source</a>)
        of beings that are slaughtered and face extreme suffering within our food systems each
        year, speciesism--differing treatment or moral consideration of
        individuals based on their species membership--may represent a massive
        moral blindspot for humanity.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
        Finally, another potentially huge moral blindspot is related to time. If
        we think that the well-being of conscious creatures alive now matters,
        it seems like that of creatures alive in the future would also matter.
        Certainly, one's birth year has no bearing on their capacity to suffer
        and those alive now are simply the future generations of the past. Due
        to this, future beings may represent a third group to consider when
        pondering our moral blindspots. If you feel discouraged by the seeming
        intractability of helping future, nonexistent beings, then you might
        feel reassured by the ideas and efforts of "longtermism" (more info
        <a
          href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/the-long-term-future/">here</a>
        and some recommendations for giving 
        <a
          href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/best-charities-to-donate-to-2020/">here</a>
        (in the recommendations for the long-term future cause area)). Since
        humanity is probably in its nascent days and future humans are
        likely to vastly outnumber all humans that have ever lived so far
        (<a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/number-of-future-people/">more on this</a>), the
        expected value of efforts aimed at the long-term future could be
        staggering.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
        You might feel overwhelmed by the number of beings and amount of
        suffering that may ought to be contained within the moral circle. The
        amount of suffering in the world <i>is</i> truly daunting and saddening.
        It used to make me feel like I wanted to pull away from the world. I'd
        internalize those emotions and feel depressed and deeply discouraged.
        Sadly, when the feelings settled, I'd move on with my life and focus on
        other things.  However, these feelings affect me differently now. When I
        think about the massive amount of suffering in the world, I still feel
        overwhelmed and saddened, but I feel less of an urge to retreat from the
        world and bury these feelings. Instead, it feels like an incredible call
        to go out into the world and take action--a call to get to work. These
        feelings of sadness and despair over the world's suffering are powerful
        and they can be used to fuel action instead of stagnant depression. May
        reality live up to our aspirations for the world and may we be driven
        forward by Angela Davis' words: "I am no longer accepting the things I
        cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept."
