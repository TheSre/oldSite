      Turning the corner, a new set of scenery comes into view.<br>
      <br>
      There is no more fighting with the noise of the world and self,<br>
      <br>
      no more struggling against a roiling choir.<br>
      <br>
      Now: deep silence in which the world's sounds are your own--<br>
      <br>
      not through ownership, but because of their immediacy.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, it's not clear who would own them,<br>
      <br>
      for you've dissolved into open space.<br>
