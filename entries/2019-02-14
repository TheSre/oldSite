                The other morning I was thinking about the The Flaming Lips lyric: "Do
                you realize...that everyone you know someday will die?". Sometimes,
                these kinds of sentences just strike you directly. It's funny how much
                wisdom is often contained inside of the completely obvious. I think
                humans have been rewarded for quickly setting aside anything that isn't
                novel in their landscape as a means to reduce extra noise and focus on
                what's essential. This is helpful in terms of productivity and survival,
                but, I think, often deleterious in other ways. Truly coming to terms
                with, for example, the fact that you have no clue how many moments you
                have left can bring about a seachange in the way you view life. This is
                more than merely recognizing the truth of such a proposition--it's
                internalizing the statement in a way that makes you feel its
                implications and weight. Doing this with the concepts of death and
                impermanence is a deeply powerful practice. 
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;  
                Though most people live their lives under the assumption that they at
                least have a considerable chunk of time left, there is nothing
                guaranteeing this in any sense. It really is the case that we have no
                clue how many more moments we have left and that impermanence is a fact
                of life. 
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;  
                And death swallows any concerns or worries one might have. The status of
                your career, your finances, your reputation--none of these matter in the face of
                death. Most probably overlook or don't pay much attention to the 
                issues that become salient in the face of death. One can imagine that
                these would include whether you are actually appreciating the days passing
                before you, whether you are making it known to the people in your life
                that you love them, whether you are present with and engaged in the
                people you interact with, whether you let petty things take hold of you
                and then react in regretful ways.
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;  
                In this way, thinking about death is not a morbid practice. Rather, it
                is one that helps you to remember how to live your life. For the most
                part, we all know what a life well-lived looks like, but it is easy to
                lose sight of this once we move out into the world and go about our
                days. So, it can be helpful to routinize these thoughts. A simple method
                is to, while having breakfast, think about how you'd like to live the
                rest of your day if it were to be cut short. This does not mean you
                should try to change your schedule, do rash, crazy things, or feel like
                your regular routine needs to be more extraordinary. Rather, this means
                you should look for the simple beauty in the events unfolding before
                you, that you should endeavor to truly connect with those around you,
                and that you should be as loving and warm as you can be. 
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;  
                If you considered the fact that you and the person who didn't hold the
                door open for you (or the person who cut you off on the road) are going
                to die someday and that it might be sooner than either of you expect,
                how angry could you actually be? If you are mindful of the fact that
                your time with your loved ones has an unknown limit, would you take for
                granted your next interaction with them? Would you be distracted by
                petty stresses while you talk to them? Death is not
                something to fearfully avoid thinking about, but is something that we
                should habitually ponder in order to reorient ourselves in life.
