      This seems accurate to me: everyone continually searches for what they
      think will make them stop searching. That thing is what they worship. My
      two cents: the choice to stop searching is one to be made now. Why think
      that the <b><i>next</i></b> thing will make you stop searching? 
      </p>

      Is it counter-productive to hate hate?

      One of my previous thoughts about always searching for the next thing has
      felt relevant lately. When I'm in the car: wanting to get to work; when
      I'm at work: wanting work to be done and to be back home; and so on. It
      feels critically important to stop in these moments, breathe, and just be
      with whatever happens to be in front of you. There may come a time when
      you wish you had more of these very moments. This could be one of your
      last moments. No one wants to get to the end of life having never lived in
      the present, constantly waiting for some future moment that never came.
      So, give up the search.  Give up the expectations. Sit with this moment,
      right now.

      Silence seems to be fertile ground for misunderstanding and distorted
      images.

      I was lamenting the fact that I'm single and don't have someone to be
      intimate with and care for, and then I remembered: you have this Earth,
      this life, this body, this self, and all of the people and animals around
      you to love tenderly and intimately care for. Don't forget what's right in
      front of you. <br> 
      <br>
      <i>Note: This is something I need to continually work on. Leaving it
      here will hopefully be a good reminder for me.</i>

			For all the thoughts we have about the way things are, all the
			expectations of how things should and shouldn't be, and all the
			daydreaming of how things were or will be, all that there ever is is the
			moment right in front of us.
