      <i>iridescence</i></a> by BROCKHAMPTON is fantastic.

      <u><b>[2019-01-15 Tue 00:00]</b></u> Touch is a great sense.
      </p>

      <u><b>[2019-01-15 Tue 00:10]</b></u> I'm more proton than punctual.

      <p>
      <u><b>[2019-01-18 Fri 00:20]</b></u> Just confident enough to use a
      semicolon.

      <u><b>[2019-01-24 Thu 11:20]</b></u> Keep your eyes open and you'll see
      that Japan has a monopoly on the pen industry.

      <p>
      <u><b>[2019-02-02 Sat 20:58]</b></u> No labels, no concepts--just as it is.
      </p>

      <p>
      <u><b>[2019-02-28 Thu 11:43]</b></u> The amount of work and knowledge that 
      has gone into making the things around you is astounding. 
      </p>
          <br>
      <p>
      <u><b>[2019-03-04 Mon 10:54]</b></u> To end a cycle of hatred you
      might have to love people who hate you. 
      </p>
          <br>
      <p>
      <u><b>[2019-04-27 Sat 10:36]</b></u> There's never just one narrative. 
      </p>
          <br>
      <p>
      <u><b>[2019-05-27 Mon 16:00]</b></u> Sometimes, rainy days really hit
          the spot. 
      </p>
          <br>
      <p>
      <u><b>[2019-06-08 Sat 14:47]</b></u> This seems accurate to me:
          everyone continually searches for what they think will make them stop
          searching. That thing is what they worship. My two cents: the choice to
          stop searching is one to be made now. Why think that the
          <b><i>next</i></b>
          thing will make you stop searching? 
      </p>
          <br>
      <p>
      <u><b>[2019-06-30 Sun 22:22]</b></u> Is it counter-productive to hate
          hate?
      </p>
          <br>
      <p>
      <u><b>[2019-08-01 Thu 18:42]</b></u> One of my previous thoughts about
      always searching for the next thing has felt relevant lately. When I'm in
      the car: wanting to get to work; when I'm at work: wanting work to be done
      and to be back home; and so on. It feels critically important to stop in
      these moments, breathe, and just be with whatever happens to be in front
      of you. There may come a time when you wish you had more of these very
      moments. This could be one of your last moments. No one wants to get to
      the end of life having never lived in the present, constantly waiting for
      some future moment that never came. So, give up the search.  Give up the
      expectations. Sit with this moment, right now.
      </p>

      <u><b>[2019-10-02 Wed 16:13]</b></u> Unapologetically sorry.
