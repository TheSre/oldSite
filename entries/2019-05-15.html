                The first time I thought of writing this I was just getting into the
                shower. Looking forward to the feeling of the nice, warm water, I
                slammed the shower dial to full heat. Of course, the water was ice
                cold at first and I immediately recoiled--mentally more than
                physically (my dorm room shower wasn't spacious enough to perform
                such a maneuver). It made me think of something my dad had said: people 
                have gotten so used to modern comforts nowadays and don't have to
                endure nearly as much physical discomfort as they once did. More
                broadly, I thought about how desire and aversion are such massive
                components of our lives and decisions and about how automatic they
                are.
                </p> 
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                We are constantly confronted by desire and aversion. I might long for
                something sweet after dinner and satisfy this desire by gorging
                myself on it. Then, I dislike the feeling of my stomach getting
                too full and stop eating. Now, the bothersome aftertaste lingers and
                I aim to get rid of it with a mint. The mint is one of those
                crumbly kinds, and after working on it for a bit, I bite straight
                into it. This leaves little mint bits in my mouth and I want to wash
                them down with a glass of water. This is a silly example, but the
                trend holds in much of life. Our actions are very frequently
                driven by our desire to have or experience things that are pleasant
                and enjoyable and by our aversion to experiencing things unpleasant or
                painful. If you keep an eye out, you will likely be shocked at all
                the (often subtle) instances of this playing out. 
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                However, you will likely find that it is quite difficult to stay
                aware of these dynamics. What makes it difficult is the automaticity
                of our reactions to things. We feel pain and we immediately
                recoil, calling the cause "bad." We feel something pleasing and we
                immediately move towards it, wanting more. The issue is that we are
                not seeing the occurrences before us very clearly in these cases and
                can quickly get caught in the traps of desire and aversion. One can
                actually see that pain is not something that innately contains
                "badness." Pain is simply a tactile sensation on which we place our
                aversion as an overlay. Pain is actually separable from this
                aversion and can just be felt as the raw sensory data one is taking
                in, removed from any emotional baggage. That said, this is not easy
                even with fairly minor pains. Similarly, when we experience
                something pleasant, we cling to it, and our enjoyment quickly fades
                to disappointment when we can no longer have the object of our
                clinging. Again, we are caught up in these extremely fast-acting
                reactions. As before, one can see the object of desire as distinct
                from the desire and realize that the desire is another passing
                feeling. One can let go of this desire and no longer cling to the
                object. It can be surprising how quickly one lets go after bringing
                this kind of awareness into the situation. Likewise, with pain, though
                it is often hard to deal with, it is surprising how much one
                relaxes after becoming more aware of the situation. The despair we
                feel from pain is a fear for the <i>future</i>. We are feeling something
                very unpleasant and wish to no longer feel it. However, we know we
                will have to, at least into the near future, and this thought
                frightens us. But we are already enduring the pain in
                the present moment. We already have the ability to handle the pain
                and this recognition alone can ease our minds. Then, when looking
                more closely at the pain, we can separate it from our aversion as 
                described above. 
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                So much of our mental suffering stems from dissatisfaction. We wish
                we had something or were currently experiencing something. We wish
                we did not have something or were not currently experiencing
                something. To have such thoughts, our attention must leave the
                present. For, how else could we think of something we don't currently
                have or experience, but want to? How else could we think of no longer
                having or experiencing something that we currently do? Remaining 
                centered on what is in
                front of us enables us to let go of these distracted thoughts that
                do not reflect reality. We can see our immediate surroundings
                clearly and realize that they are enough. We do not actually need
                all these other things. If we are in the habit of fixating on what
                we don't have or aren't experiencing, we will likely continue
                to fixate even once our current desires are gratified. Instead, we
                can simply see the automaticity of our desire and aversion and not be swept
                into the tide. We can watch these emotions appear and disappear
                without getting wrapped up in them. 
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                Observations of desire and aversion can also strengthen one's
                compassion and connection to others. One can feel one's own desire
                for happiness, well-being, and "good" things and one's aversion to
                sadness, pain, and "bad" things. Everyone feels these emotions (likely 
                many non-human conscious beings do as well). This is a
                fundamental aspect of our experience and can serve as a common ground
                with <i>everyone</i>. We can feel a strong connection even with
                strangers when reflecting on the fact that we are all confronted
                with happenings in life and often get trapped in our emotional
                reactions to them. We can see others getting trapped in this way and 
                immediately feel compassion for them since we know all too well what
                this is like. We can work to be less self-centered by considering
                the numerous desires and aversions that others are likely facing. So, 
                an awareness of desire and aversion can impact our own well-being
                and also help us to be better to others.
