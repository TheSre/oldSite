          From introspection, I've found some ugly inconsistencies in my
          extension of concern for certain beings and I think that
          self-awareness can be extremely useful, maybe essential, in improving
          our moral flaws.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
          At times, I've found myself having differential concern for certain
          beings based on their appearance. A good thought experiment which
          demonstrates what I mean is the following: Imagine a cute puppy (for
          some help, see the below image)
          <center>
            <br>
            <img src="pictures/cute-puppy.webp" alt="image of a cute puppy">
            <br>
          </center>
          and also imagine an unsightly alien creature (you can take inspiration
          from the below image). 
          <center>
            <br>
            <img src="pictures/alien.jpg" alt="image of a cute puppy">
            <br>
          </center>
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
          Now, let's assume both creatures can feel pain and suffer. If you
          imagine both beings in pain, I expect there's a stronger emotional
          reaction for the puppy. I think this tendency for the mind to have
          differing responses to the suffering of creatures based on
          morally irrelevant traits (like appearance) can have pernicious
          effects in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
          However, if we can bring an awareness to these tendencies and stay on
          the look out for more of the human mind's moral inconsistencies, I
          think there's tremendous room for improvement and growth.
