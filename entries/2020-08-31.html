          The human mind is constantly conceptualizing (or at least mine is). We
          experience a set of phenomena and immediately encapsulate it in a
          concept. Emotions exemplify this process. Try this experiment: the
          next time you feel a strong emotion, see what that emotion actually
          feels like. How do you know you are, for example, angry? What kind of
          experiential signature does anger have? In my experience, most
          emotions are primarily felt as sensations in the chest. Anxiety is
          often an upward rush through the chest, love is a kind of warm ball
          centered around the center of the chest, etc. The direct experience of
          emotions is often different from our concepts of them; we don't tend
          to think of the exact feeling of an upward rush in the chest when we
          think of anxiety. I believe this pattern widely holds: our concepts
          about our lives, reality, ourselves, and others rarely match their
          subject matter in actuality and this has a number of negative
          consequences.

          Take our ideas about plans. COVID-19 has taught me some great lessons
          on this front. As we start thinking about plans for the future, we
          begin to make them solid, concrete things in our heads. For example,
          my past internship this summer was originally going to be in Chicago.
          After accepting the offer last fall, I began thinking about all the
          things I'd be able to do in Chicago, all that I wanted to explore, and
          what my life would be like. These projections into the future had been
          fleshed out before anything, even numerous steps before them, had
          happened. As it turned out, they never would since my internship was
          made completely virtual due to COVID-19. In the moment of hearing that
          our plans have been dashed, we experience a feeling of loss. But what,
          exactly, have we lost? Often, nothing tangible. My plans for
          Chicago were nothing more than fleeting ideas bouncing around in my
          head. They represented nothing concrete, pointed to nothing in
          reality. As we fixate on our ideas about the future, we make something
          out of nothing. This isn't wholly bad--it's sometimes necessary--but
          we'd likely save ourselves a lot of heartache and mental toll if we
          didn't always jump to this behavior. Again, this is a case of our
          ideas about reality straying from reality itself. If I had considered
          what my ideas about Chicago were actually mapping to, I wouldn't have
          been able to point to anything. I would have recognized that they just
          represented something that <i>could</i> happen in the future. The
          mismatch between reality and my ideas about Chicago led to some
          feelings of loss. However, our concepts have the potential to cause
          harm beyond the boundaries of our internal lives.
