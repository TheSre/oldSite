          Lately I've become increasingly interested in independence on 
          the	Internet and decreasingly interested in social media. Many elements of
          social media feel unhealthy to me. Most of the time I can frankly say
          that I leave my encounters with social media feeling that I either
          gained nothing or was negatively affected. I especially notice that
          social media tampers with my ability to feel at ease in and focused on the
          present. Instead, I fixate on things happening elsewhere and am pulled out of
          the moment. 
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
          I find the idea of a more decentralized Internet compelling. With the
          size and influence of massive social media platforms, it feels like much
          of the Internet is filtered through these companies that can act as
          gatekeepers in an environment that should be free and unbound. To that
          end, people can act as their own gatekeepers of the content that they output
          on the Internet. Maintaining a personal website seems like a good option
          and actually feels more meaningful than I would have guessed. In doing so, 
          I can have what is essentially a wide open creative space that I can 
          share with others. I don't have to pipe what I say or make through a large,
          regulating company. I can occupy a small corner of the Internet that is
          free of the odd psychological effects of social media. I can have
          something that I directly constructed--down to the last coloring or
          spacing choice. Finally, I can gain the requisite knowledge to do all of
          this. Greater independence on the Internet is exciting to me and this
          feels like a step in that direction. I like the vision of the Internet
          as a loose network of small, open villages more so than as a centralized,
          rigid collection of dominating megacities.

          I realize that the above writing likely sounds preachy. It isn't
          intended to be. These are just some of the reasons I'm trying this out.
          I can clearly see why there aren't swarms of people	trying to do this. It's 
          time-consuming, tedious work. But it--and most technology-related
          work--is exciting to me. So, I do it.

          Some of the ideas I touch on here are wonderfully expanded
          on at <a href="https://humanetech.com/">the Center for
            Humane Technology's website</a>. I highly recommend checking
          it out. I think they have some very important things to say
          that seemingly very few people are saying and taking note
          of. Their <a href="https://ledger.humanetech.com/"> "Ledger
            of Harms"</a> is very interesting, and to me, feels like
          quite a good wake-up call.
