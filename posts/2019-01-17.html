          Honesty is difficult. It certainly is a good goal and the alternative
          causes all kinds of problems. People rely on accurate information to be
          able to properly operate in the world. Refusing them this diminishes their
          ability to do so. Lying fractures relationships and gives
          others good reason to hesitate in trusting the liar. And if one is lying
          in the first place, motives should be questioned. Why is it that you
          need to mask your true actions or thoughts in deception? The need to
          cover up suggests something foul underneath.

          I envision a truly honest person as one who speaks her mind about the
          things that matter to her (speaking one's mind about all things seems
          unnecessary, noisy, and misaligned with the goals of honesty). Such a
          person would explain exactly how he feels when asked, would not hide
          views or behaviors out of embarrassment when they are in question, and
          would tell those around him when he believes they have done something
          wrong. She would expect and hope that others would do the same to her.
          These people would give--and take--such advice not as censure, but as
          genuine hope for another to improve. In this sense, speaking one's
          mind about the faults of another is more altruistic than remaining quiet 
          out of fear of hurting the other's feelings. One who does the former may
          be seen as rude, and so risks reputation in order to help the other 
          person grow.

          That said, this is not easy. Most people <i>will</i> take your words 
          as an attack and immediately rise to defense. Reasoning with someone in
          this state is rarely successful. Equally futile is getting them to see
          your good intentions. Therefore, in order to get to a place where people
          can be altruistically honest with each other, some actions must be
          taken. First, I think it's important to make your good intentions as
          obvious as they can be without distorting the truth. If you want people
          to believe that you come from a place of kindness, give them a reason
          to. Secondly, I think it would be productive if people viewed criticism
          differently. To be clear, I'm not saying that I'm a paragon of this
          behavior by any means; I struggle with this situation all the time. But if 
          people suspended their ego and recognized criticism as the useful 
          information it is, I think there would be much more personal growth in 
          the world. One might even go as far as thanking the critic for being honest 
          and contributing to personal improvement.

          That said, this too is not easy. Here, honesty is again helpful. When
          you're honest with yourself, criticism becomes easier to deal with. You 
          can let go of your attachment to being right, admit your faults, and more
          clearly see	your mind and personality. This last point is especially helpful
          to me. The reality is that one's personality is the sum of myriad factors.
          People feel the stab of criticism because they think that they are the
          sole authors of the book of personality. This is not the case.
          Personality's influences go far beyond the individual. The self is
          like a project over which we don't have full (or maybe any<span
                                                                      class="noteMarker">*</span>) creative control. We can
                                                                    see personal judgement not as an attack, but as a helpful assessment of
                                                                    this lifelong project.

          <span class="noteMarker">*</span>This could be an entire, separate
          post, but just to clarify: I'm not saying people should not be held
          accountable for themselves. Even if it's the case that people have no
          control over their own personalities, blame and accountability are
          still useful: they can act as factors that shape people and their
          personalities. That is, they could be a helpful fiction. Even if
          people actually aren't to blame for their actions, blame is too useful
          to let go of.
