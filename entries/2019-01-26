          It's bizarre how at odds your "external self"<span
                                                         class="noteMarker">*</span> can be with your "internal
                                                       self." I often have the experience that I say or do things that feel
                                                       incongruous with how I truly feel or would like to act. Sometimes, this
                                                       is a result of emotion: I might act more hastily than I'd like because
                                                       of impatience. But the more strange case is when strong feelings play no
                                                       such role. I might be having a great conversation with close friends,
                                                       feel completely at ease, and still act in a way that I dislike. If I
                                                       don't want to act in that way, why do I so blatantly?	
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
          Just as puzzling, changes in one's immediate environment can produce great swings
          in behavior. In some situations, I feel quite confident, at ease,
          social, and quick to crack a joke. In others, I feel like a lifelong
          hermit who, having reached old age, has decided to crawl out of his hole
          and make his first attempt at human interaction. And this pattern of
          polarity is repeated for just about every other trait. 
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
          As if we were watching another person, our actions appear to unravel
          before us. It's almost as if our behavior is the automatic output of a 
          reaction that consists of factors like setting, the people around us, our 
          current mood, our general behavioral tendencies, and so on. Rather than us 
          authoring our actions and thoughts, it often feels that this reaction occurs 
          and we see simply see its result appear. Ultimately, I think this dynamic 
          illustrates a fundamental quality of our minds and behavior and I might dive 
          into this in another entry at some point. 
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
          With this said, I think we have good reason to try to be gentler with
          others and ourselves. The person we might get angry with for being
          inconsiderate may later be truly upset with herself for acting this way.
          And though you said something that you dislike, you should not feel
          chained to this flawed, older self. Our continuous vacillation means that
          no one is constant and everyone is corrigible.

          <span class="noteMarker">*</span>I don't claim that these are actually two distinct 
          things. Rather, I
          think the appearance that they are further reflects the self's dynamism
          and complexity.
