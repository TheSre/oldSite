          The human mind is constantly conceptualizing (or at least mine is). We
          experience a set of phenomena and immediately encapsulate it in a
          concept. Emotions exemplify this process. Try this experiment: the
          next time you feel a strong emotion, see what that emotion actually
          feels like. How do you know you are, for example, angry? What kind of
          experiential signature does anger have? In my experience, most
          emotions are primarily felt as sensations in the chest. Anxiety is
          often an upward rush through the chest, love is a kind of warm ball
          centered in the upper torso, etc. The direct experience of
          emotions is often different from our concepts of them; we don't tend
          to think of the exact feeling of an upward rush in the chest when we
          think of anxiety. I believe this pattern widely holds: our concepts
          about our lives, reality, ourselves, and others rarely match their
          subject matter in actuality and this has a number of negative
          consequences.

          Take our ideas about plans. COVID-19 has taught me some great lessons
          on this front. As we start thinking about plans for the future, we
          begin to make them solid, concrete things in our heads. For example,
          my past internship this summer was originally going to be in Chicago.
          After accepting the offer last fall, I began thinking about all the
          things I'd be able to do in Chicago, all that I wanted to explore, and
          what my life would be like. These projections into the future had been
          fleshed out before anything even numerous steps before them had
          happened. As it turned out, they never would since my internship was
          made completely virtual due to COVID-19. In the moment of hearing that
          our plans have been dashed, we experience a feeling of loss. But what,
          exactly, have we lost? Often, nothing tangible. My plans for
          Chicago were nothing more than fleeting ideas bouncing around in my
          head. They represented nothing concrete, pointed to nothing in
          reality. As we fixate on our ideas about the future, we make something
          out of nothing. This isn't wholly bad--it's sometimes necessary--but
          we'd likely save ourselves a lot of heartache and mental toll if we
          didn't always reinforce this pattern. Again, this is a case of our
          ideas about reality straying from reality itself. If I had considered
          what my ideas about Chicago were actually mapping to, I wouldn't have
          been able to point to anything. I would have recognized that they just
          represented something that <i>could</i> happen in the future. The
          mismatch between reality and my ideas about Chicago led to some
          feelings of loss. However, our concepts have the potential to cause
          harm beyond the boundaries of our internal lives.
        </p>

          When applied to other people, our conceptualizing can have even more
          harmful effects. Though many of us mean well and want to avoid placing
          others in mental boxes by making generalizations about them, our minds
          often do this automatically and subtly. Many of these mental
          tendencies have likely proven useful: our minds can save a lot of time
          and energy by forming a template for a group of things or people and
          immediately recalling this template when later seeing members of that
          group. This allows us to not have to relearn everything about that
          person or thing everytime we see them. This no doubt had survival
          ramifications for early humans. Being able to quickly identify members
          of rival or friendly groups could be the difference between life and
          death. However, in modern society, this habit can have different, harmful
          effects. In making split-second categorizations of people and things,
          we can very easily maintain assumptions and ideas about people that
          are unfair, unflattering, unjust, or simply untrue. It is
          astonishingly easy to do this--even for the most well-meaning folks.
          If you ever watch your internal attitudes towards categorizations of
          people or things, you will quickly see this. As a result, it is
          helpful to constantly challenge your assumptions--to look past our
          automatic ideas about people to see what reality is actually like.
        </p> 
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
          Further, when we group people and things in this way, we confine them
          to simplified, restrictive, and boring versions of their real selves. 
          <!--Go on to talk about how our concepts can restrict us, make things
          less interesting, how freeing and beautiful it can be to break out of
          these molds.-->
        </p> 
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;
          Ultimately, this process of "concept cracking" can lead us to see some
          of the myriad ways we are wrong about reality. It can teach us
          that--to the dismay of the aspect of our brains that want to classify,
          define, explain, and understand everything--reality is much messier,
          bigger, and more complicated than can often be captured in the neat
          concepts we dream up. This isn't an all out war on ideas, however. Of
          course, our ideas are often extremely useful, exciting, and
          transformative. It is however, a call to constantly stress test our
          thoughts about "the way things are" to ensure we don't oversimplify
          and overclassify the world, losing touch with its depth,
          unpredictability, and incredible complexity.
